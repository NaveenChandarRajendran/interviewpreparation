Event loop-
    The javascript is the single thread language,It will do one work at a time.

But it handle multi task effortlessly with the help of Event loop.

Core Things come under Event Loop is
    - Event Queue
    - Call Stack
    - Event Loop


Event Queue
    Imagine a queue where events are lined up.
    The events can be user interaction like (click,key press etc....), network request (fetch data), timers, or any action that does'nt happen quickly.

Call Stack
    This is the place (stack) where Javascript keeps track of the code.
    Each Function call make it entries on the stack and remove when the funtion is completed.

Event loop
    This Loop is main part as it keep on monitoring the two essentials
    The Call Stack :
        If the call stack is empty( i.e no code is there to execute), the event loop will consider its time to pick a new task.
    The Event Queue :
        If there is any pending task , the event loop pick the first one in line.

Example

console.log("start");

setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("timer");
},2000)

console.log("End");

//synchronous work
for(let i=0; i < 1000000; i++){

}

console.log("Loop finished");
