Observerbility
    This means we can analize what is happening inside our application with following some metrics.
    This can help developers to understand the how systems are performing, identify and troubleshoot issues, and improve reliability and performance.

Core points are 
    - Logs
    - metrics
    - Traces

Logs
    Logs are detailed ,timestamp of the activities which are happening in our application.
    ex - If user login in to our web application, the log will be registed with details of userid , timestamp and wheather the user is logged in successfully or not.

Metrics
    Metrics are numerical data points which collected over the time period, to measure the system performance.
    ex - CPU usage,memory consuption and request rates.

Traces
    Traces represent the end to end journey of the request through the distributed system (microservices).
    ex - In a microservices architecture , a trace might show user request flow through various services (auth service,user profile service,order processing services.)


Tools

For Logs: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk.
For Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana.
